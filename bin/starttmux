## This script starts tmux.
##  * If there are multiple tmux sessions, the script drops you to a shell and
##    won't connect to a random session (therefore, you can't have some hidden
##    ones by accident.
##  * On each connect, detached mosh sessions are getting killed
##  * You can connect from multiple clients to the same session, as long as all
##    are currently connected. This obviates the need for the mosh/tmux hack:
##    "attach -d"
##  * invoking remote commands via "ssh host command" or "mosh host command"
##    is still possible. Therefore things like scp are also still usable.
## 
## INSTALL
## prepend the line of your public key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with
## command="~/starttmux" and a white space afterwards.
